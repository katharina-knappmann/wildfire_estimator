The devastating wildfires caused by climate change, particularly raging in Australia, 
require countermeasures such as extinguishing and containing them.  
In order to plan firefighting resources, forecasting models become more and more important, 
to assess which regions will be affected and how severely, based on weather forecasts. 
Therefore, in this master thesis different forecast models are developed and compared 
based on their forecast accuracy. Furthermore, an insight into the relationships between 
weather data and forest fires learned by the machine learning models will be shown, 
on the basis of which new risk mitigation measures can be built.
